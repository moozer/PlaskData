Second semester will continue with more advanced networking and programming. As command line litteracy is important for profesional IT people, linux is introduced both as an example of an operating system, as a scripting platform and also for the diversity in server service available.

The goal of the semester is to form the students to become self motivated IT profesional, who, in third semester, are able to run diverse IT projects in an independant manner.
