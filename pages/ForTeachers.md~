Course manager
--------------

This is basically a python script using [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), templates and [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) files to enable autogeneration of course descriptions and cross linking them.

This is the first attempt, but it has its uses :-)

* Course descriptions are found [here](/Plask/fagplan/)
* Cross course overview are found [here](/Plask/overview/)

In the overview select the exam questions. It should be a good example why this structure is useful.

Also, all this is maintained in a local git repo, and the sources should be available [here](/PlaskSrc/).
