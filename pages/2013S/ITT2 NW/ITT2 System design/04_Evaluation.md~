The course is evaluated as a part of the 2. semester exam.

Some comments about optional question hand-ins:

* They will not be individually evaluated. 
* They serve a dual pupose. The first is to give the teacher an impression of the general level in class. The second is for each student to know his/her individual level.
* In the following lecture a volunteer will present the question.
