	Case: A user is able to delete datasets and to save the datasets to disc. Both cases requires the user to select the dataset first. Two computers are automatically uploading the datasets at given intervals. If the two computers upload at the same time, an error is issued.

	* Draw the use case diagram 
	* Explain all elements of a use case diagram for the above case. 
	* Explain what use case diagrams are used for. 

2.	Activity diagrams

	Case: To make a tomato salad, you first have to buy the ingredients (onions, tomatos, feta cheese). Then you must cut the tomatoes and the onions. The order is not important, they may even be cut at the same time. Mix the ingredients and serve it.

	* Draw the activity diagram 
	* Explain all elements used in the activity diagram. 
	* Explain what activity diagrams are used for. 

3.	Sequence and communication diagrams

	Case: On a local area network, users are forces to use a proxy for all HTTP traffic. Users all use workstations named Work01, Work02 and so on. The proxy server is called Proxy01 and whenever it receives a request it will forward the request to the appropriate web server on the internet. The internal DNS server used by the workstations is called Dns01, and the DNS server used by the proxy is called DnsIsp01. Both IP adresses of the DNS servers are known. 

	* Draw the communication diagram 
	* Explain all elements used in the communication diagram
	* Draw the sequence diagram 
	* Explain all elements used sequence diagram
	* Explain what communication and sequence diagrams are used for
