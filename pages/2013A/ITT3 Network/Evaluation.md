The teacher board and education management will at the end of the semester evaluate who is eligible to
go to the exam.

* The semester is evaluated at the end of the semester at an oral exam.
* To be eligible to take the exam, all subjects must be approved.
* Each subject and project plan will contain the specific criteria to pass for each subject and project.
* Each subject will have a midway evaluation in week 45. The subject plans will stipulate the passing criteria.
* Selected projects and their reports will be part of the exam.
* Reports handed in on time will be evaluated by the corresponding teacher shortly after deadline.
* If a student fails to hand in a report or a home work on time, it is her/his obligation to make a written agreement with the teacher on what to do. Failing to do so might exclude the student from the exam.
