The course is evaluated with a test at the end of the semester and the successful implementation of Project Network which is split up in 2 parts 

* Part-1: Configuration and implementation of a LAN infrastructure per group, consisting of workstations (one per group member), a Server of choice and a Switch. Connectivity must be tested and be fully functional between all nodes in the LAN. 
* Part-2: Configure and implement a WAN infrastructure per group, using a Router. Each group-LAN will connect to two (2) or more of the other group LANs and must use two (2) or more routing protocols. Connectivity must be tested and be fully functional between the networks connected.

Mandatory hand-in:

1. High- & Low Level Design document for LAN (per group).
2. High- & Low Level Design document for WAN (per group).
3. Periodic Progress Reports (per group), including presentation, during Project Network
4. Develop a Presentation per group upon completion of “Project Network”, explaining the end result, stating issues during implementation and how these issues were resolved.
