status: This is for both Netowrking and project network. It should be reduced to 5-10 for each course.

Having completed this course the student will be able to

* Explain what a Structured Cabling System (SCS) is, itâ€™s purpose and the Standards behind it. 
* Explain what a Protective Distribution System (PDS) is, and the difference between the two cabling standards SCS and PDS.
* Explain how Wireshark functions as well as describing the result that Wireshark presents.
* Use Wireshark to collect packages and filter them to show specific information related to protocols or hosts.
* Describe in broad terms what IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) is and the functionality of the Sub-Layers.
* Explain how a L2 switched network is functioning with regards to functionality of the MAC and LLC Layers and the ARP/RARP tables.
* Explain how Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) works, and when, and its purpose.
* Given an IPv4 address block, subnet this block in smaller IP networks/Subnets, manually and using an IP Subnet Calculator.
* Explain the IPv6 architecture and how it differs from IPv4
* Explain how NAT and PAT work and what they are used for.
* Describe how VLANs work and what they are used for.
* Describe how Static Routing works 
* Describe how Dynamic Routing works 
* Describe how OSPF works with Areas, both Inter-Area and Intra-Area, and Implement it on Routers.
* Describe how IS-IS works with Levels, both Inter-Area (Level-1) and Intra-Area (Level-2).
* Describe how Router Resilience Protocols work with HSRP and VRRP.
* Describe how a link-state routing algorithm work, in this case SPF. 
* Describe and Implement Route Distribution between routing protocols in a Router.
* Explain how LSAs/LSPs are distributed and the selection methods of the Designated Router (DR).
* Describe how a distance-vector algorithm and Router information protocol (RIP, IGRP etc.) work.
* Implement a multi IP Network environment with dynamic routing.
* Explain the scalability issues concerning routing protocols such as OSPF, IS-IS and BGP.
