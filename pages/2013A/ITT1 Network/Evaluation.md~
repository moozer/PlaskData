At the begining of the semester, a test or evaluation must be passed to continue the education.

Each subject will contain a description of hand-ins, presentations or other activities during the course. It will also contain the specific evaluation criterias to pass the course. In order to be illigible to take the exam at the end of the semester, all courses must be passed.

The semester as a whole is evaluated by an exam at the end of 2nd semester, which must be passed in order to continue to 3rd semester.
